#Implementing Flood Pipe Puzzle Game Using Java

This game is implemented using Java, with two main components: a GUI and a logic component. The GUI was created using JavaFX and allows the user to interact with the game board through a graphical interface. The logic component handles the game mechanics, including generating random game boards, checking for win conditions, and filling the pipes algorithmically.

The game board is generated randomly each time the game is started, ensuring that each game is unique and challenging. The user can customize the difficulty level by selecting the board size and the number of pipe pieces.

To make the game more engaging, I implemented an animation that fills the pipes in an iterative algorithm. The animation speed can be adjusted by the user in the settings page.
